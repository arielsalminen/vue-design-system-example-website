# Using Vue Design System as an NPM dependency on a static website

## Testing from a remote repository

1. Clone this repository
2. Run `npm install`
3. Now you can run `npm run serve` to test that the design system build and its components work.
4. When youâ€™re ready to start testing your own system library, switch the `vue-design-system` dependency in the package.json to point to your own private repository.
